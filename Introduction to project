Aim
        This project aims at making the process of setting up online voting system in India an extent automatic. 
        The proposed model has a greater security in the sense that voter high security password is confirmed before the vote is 
        accepted in the main database of Election Commission of India.
        The additional feature of the model is that the voter can confirm if his/her vote has gone to correct candidate/party.
        In this model a person can also vote from outside of his/her allotted constituency or from his/her preferred location. 
        In the proposed system the tallying of the votes will be done automatically, thus saving a huge time and enabling 
        Election Commissioner of India to announce the result within a very short period.
        
        Requirements
        •	Redhat Linux preferably though any Linux system would work
        •	Docker
        •	Docker-compose
        Setting up the enviorment  :
        •	You need to configure yum by adding docker.repo inside
           /etc/yum.repos.d
            for local installation                     using: https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo  
         Then run:
         yum install docker-ce --nobest
         Starting Docker :
         systemctl start docker
         Installation of Docker Compose
         curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m`
         -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
          chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
          After Installation of above file
          systemctl start docker
          systemctl enable docker
Docker Compose provides a way to orchestrate multiple containers that work together.
Examples include a service that processes requests and a front-end web site, or a service that uses a supporting function 
such as a Redis cache. If you are using the microservices model for your app development, you can use Docker Compose to
factor the app code into several independently running services that communicate using web requests.
